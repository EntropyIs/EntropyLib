# Entropy Library
Project for rudimentary Game Engine implementing required components for programming games.

This project is more about the components of the engine itself rather than the games themselves, but will include example projects that utilize the engine to produce replica's of well known games such as a platormer or scrolling shooter.

## Project Plan
The plan for the project will take place in several stages, roughly as follows:

1. Graphics Engine Components:
   1. Basic Graphics Window Components
      1. OpenGL windows functions
      1. GLSL Shader Technology
      1. Image Texture/Sprite Processing
   1. Object Space Seperation
      1. Render
1. Game Object Handling
   1. Object Transformations
      1. Scaling
      1. Translation
      1. Rotation
   1. Object Containers
      1. TODO: expand.
   1. ???
1. Documentation
   1. Engine Wiki
      1. Overview of components
      1. Explination of how components operate

TODO: expand and refine project plan.

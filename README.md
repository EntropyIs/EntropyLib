# Entropy Library
Project for rudimentary Game Engine implementing required components for programming games.

This project is more about the components of the engine itself rather than the games themselves, but will include example projects that utilize the engine to produce replica's of well known games such as a platormer or scrolling shooter.

## Project Plan
The plan for the project will take place in several stages, roughly as follows:

1. Basic Graphics Window Components
2. Object Transformations
3. Sprite Rendering

TODO: expand and refine project plan.
